I bought some furniture from Leons recently and they offered to price match for 3 months. This is my first python script and it was fun getting it all working. The script will basically scrape the prices of the certain items from Leons website and compare the prices from the website to what I bought it for. Accordingly it will update an html page running on my home server and if it finds any item for a lower price it will send me an email with the item that is priced lower so that I can call the store to price match it.

I watched some videos from Kalle Hallden that gave me the idea that I should create a script for this - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWr0mx597DnSGLFk1WfvSkQ . I will write a blog entry about this whole setup and how I put it as a chron job on my ubuntu server - I blog about my tech learnings and about such experiments as I learn to code on my website www.sartajsinghill.com .
